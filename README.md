# CornHub
Gardening app for hardcore gardeners

# Project Brief

In one week, build a full-stack app (PostgreSQL, Python/Django, React) with CRUD functionality, working solo, in a pair, or in a group of three. I opted for the latter, and recruited Jonty Ward and Michael Henderson to form a team.

# Overview and Concept

I am an avid gardener, and find that I often have to consult multiple sources in order to find all of the information I need concerning sowing, fertilizing, watering and any number of other crucial matters. I thought that it would be wonderful to have an app where all of this information was at my fingertips, with several different approaches to searching and filtering - for example, by month, name, species, temperature or difficulty. Additionally, I wanted it to have a dark, humorous aesthetic, as my own experience of tilling clay-like soil in 30 degree heat with thrash metal in my headphones didnâ€™t really match with the cosy, middle-class image that gardening can often have. Accordingly, I called it CornHub.
